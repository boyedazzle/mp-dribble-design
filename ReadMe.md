# MONIEPOINT DRIBBLE DESIGN APP

# About the App
This project is majorly a design application to show ones strength using the jetpack composable library

The app is a delivery application that tracks shipped items with an history of completed, pending, in-progress

and cancelled transaction. It also shows a tracking system user interface where the user of the app can see

the progress of their delivery

## Jetpack Compose Previews

This annotation generates both light mode (API 29) and dark mode (API 35) previews 

but the dark mode is disabled for better user experience right now.

## Design

Below is a link to the design screen https://dribbble.com/shots/21617837-Movemate-Shipments-Mobile-App and the task is to come up

with a mobile translation of the link provided, replicating as much as possible the screens shown in the video, the scroll behaviours, effects

and animations

## Architecture

This is not primarily the main purpose of this project hence no architectural pattern was adopted

## Data

The data provided on the app where all hardcoded so no network calls with api client or application database

## Note

This application is still very much a work in progress has there are no explicit design information provided to better

simply it's work but just remembering different cases on the fly
